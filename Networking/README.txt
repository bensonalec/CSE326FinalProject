The server is built using Server5.java Client.java and Frame.java.

Build done in eclipse ide, the .jar file executable is left in this directory. 

The .java files will be in server_test. The are made to be used in an IDE so to manually compile the package must be removed from the files. 

To run server you need to log into jerry.cs.nmt.edu and run java -jar Server5.jar -Xmg6G from the ~/server/ directory under account user.

Other .java files were used for server testing along with Server5_hashing.java which is an implementation of the server using hashing this was not completed though so we stuck to server5.java.
